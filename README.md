# VBA-Challenge
Data Science Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge: 
This challenge uses Excel and VBA to analyze and summarize stock data over a 3-year period

I worked with Student Support Services (Ask BCS learning assistant) to complete the assignment. They helped me with constructing the for loop for the summary metrics (yearly change & percent change). They also helped with the max, min, and match functions needed for the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, & Greatest Total Volume. This can be found in the Final Script text file.
